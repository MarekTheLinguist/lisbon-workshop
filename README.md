# Lisbon workshop in statistics with R
This is a repository with files and instructions to the statistics workshop. R is a programming language used for statistical computing. R is used universally in linguistics, psychology and the social sciences to run statistical tests and perform modelling. It's open source, available free of charge (unlike some other software, like IBM SPSS), and highly extensible through many of its libraries (we will use some of them). R is a functional language, which means that we apply mathematical functions to objects we manipulate. It also has multiple functionalities for "data wrangling", meaning that it is possible to prepare and modify data within it. 

You can of course write R code in a notepad and then run it from terminal/command line, but nobody really does that. R comes with RStudio - an integrated development environment, i.e. a set of tools to develop, modify and test your code. 

## Before our meeting, please do the following:
### install and download R: https://cran.radicaldevelop.com/
